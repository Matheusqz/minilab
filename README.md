# Minilab

`Minilab` provides the foundations to build the UI and is agnostic to it.

- Lumino Signals
- Lumino Extension Machinery
- The Lumino Setttings
- The Lumino Commands
- The JupyterLab Services
- The JupyterLab App and App-Utils

It does not ship the Lumino Layouts not the Lumino Panels.

So you would come on top with e.g. `lab-react`, `lab-vue`...

`lab-react` and `lab-vue` can communicate via `Minilab`.
